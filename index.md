## Welcome to HCI Final Project for Alexandra Wheeler

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Wheeleral/HCIDesign/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Who am I?
I am Alexandra Wheeler, senior student at WPI. I study robotic engineering and computer science. My ideal job would be working on the design of interfaces between humans and robots. And yes, robotics engineering in my main major. I'm going to be working at Rocket Software come june 2019 and plan to go back to graduate school in a few years. 


## How my design methods have changed

Not every design can translate into reality
  - sometimes user testing shows what you thought of as amazing is a terrible idea, ie a very sarcastic chat bot, paper protoype for others
  - technical limitations ie chat bot trying to get looping, utilizing the canvas js to get a realtime graph
  
Pay attention to whos using it
  - whats most interesting to them? -> where their eyes go at first affectiva, good with vega
  - Does it need to be fancy with all those thing ama bobs? sometimes simple works
  
 A defined user testing works well
 - just giving a user a product and say go at it doesn't necessarily give you the most feedback, while you want them to understand the product without explaining, having an explanation of how the testing is going to go can facilitate it better
 - have questions
 
 Do some research about the topic
 - you may think you have an idea, but research can prove that its not the best way
 - others have done similar things, go find wha works -godd/bad design
 - looking at other prototypes in class lead to interesting ideas
 
 Don't give up.
 - if you think you don't know how to do this or that don't let it stop you. There may be a different way to do it
    - ie understanding - used the javascript on hover commands to provide interacctivity when it was hard to get vega working
 - I've done some work with ar and a little with aframe, ihaven't done any intensive vr work. We created somethign that looks amazing with very little code. But it was a group effort and once the ball got rolling everything kept working well. 
 
 
 

How did the design process impact the decisions you made? 
What were the most valuable pieces? 
Were there limitations to the design process that you encountered?
How did this differ across different modalities? 
For example, maybe user testing with your prototypes was more illuminating in one modality than another. 
Maybe the true capabilities of the technology constrained you more in one modality than another.
When did expectations not meet reality?
Were there some topic areas that were more challenging than others? What did you learn from this process?


What are the important points that you would want to communicate to someone who hasn’t taken HCI before?


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Wheeleral/HCIDesign/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
