## Welcome to HCI Final Project for Alexandra Wheeler

## Who am I?
I am Alexandra Wheeler, senior student at WPI. I study robotic engineering and computer science. My ideal job would be working on the design of interfaces between humans and robots. And yes, robotics engineering in my main major. I'm going to be working at Rocket Software come june 2019 and plan to go back to graduate school in a few years. 


## How my design methods have changed
Before this class I have never given so much thought into design. The design of a product is more than the functionality, does it work as it is intended. How it looks, what attracts users to using the product, what do users see when they first look at the product, what is the feel of the product; all of that is important in trying to make a well designed product. Through this class I know how to define those questions and I now can give my own impacts from the class.
### Design vs Reality
The first thing I learned and learned quickly is that not every design can translate into reality. This point is split into two concepts, ideas that just do not work and ideas that technically limited. Sometimes user testing shows what you thought of as amazing is a terrible idea. This has two instances that I distinctly remember, the paper prototype for design for others and the design for tension. 

In design for others, our group had amazing ideas in how to compact a lot of content that the Worcester public library had on their web page into a design for mobile. We ran into several hiccups as the ideas we thought of did not work well in user testing. Such as our main page, we thought a simple page with little content would work as that was similar to what the main page of the library was already. However, many people quickly pointed out that they thought the main page was lacking things. This lead to us redesigning the main page. 
Main page of design for othersAnother instance of this was in regards to personality of a chat bot of design for tension. When I created an initial prototype I thought that a sarcastic bot would work well, to try and ease the tension of the topic. But when trying to make this, it translated into more of a aggressive tone that I did not want. 

There is also the technical limitations. Many things that you want to do, but you just do not know how to. Or that there is issues with the functional aspects of the product that detract from the product as a whole. There were several instances of this through out the term such as trying to use vega or getting the chat bot to loop messages. The one that ended up impacting user testing was in design for well being. We tried to have real-time graph of the emotions run. We researched the best way to do it with limited time, and decided on canvas js. However, we ended up with a graph that struggled to update as often as we wanted. It could get several seconds behind, a very noticeable difference. Several testers did take note of this problem, however the I do not think it impacted the overall experience of the page. 
### The User
The second concept from the class, is to pay attention to who is using the product. This was emphasized in the Design for others, but is shown in every project. Many times the user is not you, this makes it hard to design as you know what the product is, you know what makes you smile. But do you know if another person knows what is going on, do you know what is interesting to them. An interesting way to do this is to follow their eyes and or mouse cursor and see where someone else looks. Is the first thing their eyes go to what you intended, or is it something else. 

In design for well being, we thought the users eyes would be drawn to the text in the top left corner, as that was the instructions. However, almost everyone looked at the video first and tried to play it. This was not intended to happen. But as our group was the one designing the page, we did not notice this until user testing happened. 
We had a good experience with this in the design for understanding. The users looked at the graphs on the left at first then their eyes slowly went to the right. This was what was intended for the experience as it gave the user a good view allowing them to form opinions before reading ours. 

One thing I like is that the pages do not need to be fancy with all the bobbles you can try and fit. Sometimes simple like Design for Understanding does. You can make a product communicate your page with something simple. 
### Define User Testing
Something that I had first hand experience is that a defined user testing works well. Just giving a user a product and say go at it, does not necessarily give you the most feedback or any to be exact. While you want them to understand the product without explaining, having an explanation of how the testing is going to go can facilitate the testing better. 
Along those lines, have questions to ask the user of the application at the end. This not only forces them to think critically about the product, but gives consistency in the answers. Allowing you to narrow the focus of what is good and what needs improving. 

User testing in design for well beingThroughout the course, I have continually gotten better at making sure we had a more defined user testing. In the beginning, we just went about and got what the user said to us. As we progressed we had 2–3 questions to ask at the end of testing, along with additional comments people made during the testing. This allowed us to improve our projects, making them better and more user friendly. In the beginning, we did not know how to improve the project but with the addition of questions we were able to explicitly define things that the tester identified as needs improvement. 
### Actually Research
When creating something new, research can go a long way or in more exact terms just do some research about the topic. Research can change how you design a product. There are so many different ways to do research from readings about the topic, readings about similar things, readings about design, or even just looking at similar ideas. 

You may think you have an idea, but research can prove that it may not be the best way to display the product. This was shown with the chat bots. I never though about personality for chat bots. However the reading Designing chatbots by Yogesh Moorjani (Link to the article), changed my perspective on how to design them. The exploration of the good/bad design testing was interesting as not only I had to research design techniques I had to see if others applied them. Along those same lines, it was interesting to look, during user testing, at other peoples prototypes and designs. It provided a good perspective to see how others tried using the same tools to solve the same prompt.

### Do not give up.
If you think that you do not know how to do this or that; do not let that stop you. There may be a different way to do it, or you can find a way to pseudo implement it. 

One example of this was during the design for understanding. Our group had a hard time utilizing interaction with vega. So instead our group used the javascript on hover commands to provide interactivity when it was hard to get vega working.
Additionally, I have done some work with AR and a little with aframe. I have not done any intensive VR work. We created something that looks amazing with very little code. We wanted to create a maze, and with out using anything crazy we were able to accomplish our goal and do so much more. But it was a group effort and once the ball got rolling everything kept working well.

### In Conclusion
There are many ways one can approach a design project. While I have explored a few ways to do so, there are many more that I can do in the future. Sometimes your expectations do not meet reality, and that is okay. Some things are challenging, but you can persevere. I at the very least can say that this class changed my methods of design. 
So to sum everything up:
- Not every idea has a direct translation into reality
- Pay attention to who is using the product
- Define how you will test your users
- Research
- Do not give up

Design impacts everyone from the developers to the users, do not be afraid to go out side the box or just stay right inside it.
